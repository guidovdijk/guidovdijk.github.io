                With constant development and expansion of both The Valley their
                websites and respective components, a mismatch can occur in
                functionality between these components. This component library
                is to provide a proof-of-concept that: prevents/minimize
                functionality mismatches, by creating a centralized component
                registry. It describes how these components should be setup and
                has a demo environment with documentation and demonstration for
                these components.

                I made this project for a company I am not comfortable by making
                the GitHub repository public. I did however add a few code
                snippets on this page.

                The Component Library
              </h3>
              <p className="text-body">
                With the library I wanted to make sure that the development
                cycle and the usage of Git is the same as that of the websites,
                while also be able to have a centralized development platform
                where these components can be made. After researching different
                repository-structures, a decision had been made to use a
                “Poly-as-Mono” repository structure. This allows all components
                to be in a separated Git repository and have a separate
                node_modules folder, but still be able to be loaded into the
                same development platform. By using this we do not need multiple
                copies of Webpack, Gulp, and NPM development packages per
                component, which reduces the amount of data on your hard drive.

                JSDoc, SCSS Doc, and, for the HTML, inline markdown syntax in
                combination with a separate Gulp task are used to document the
                code and make sure it can be written in the files itself. This
                kind of documentation will also be converted to HTML and put
                into the demo page. This way developers can check how the code
                work in the demo environment, without the need to navigate to
                the separate files. Also, the comments get converted to Markdown
                and saved in a separate file, so it can be easily read in the
                DevOps environment or GitHub repository.

                The demo environment shows three parts. A demo showing the

                the documentation of the README.md file. The demo environment
                has been designed to look (almost) identical to The Valley their

                <br />
                The documentation shown on the page is taken form inline
                comments in the component their JavaScript, SCSS, HTML files,
                and the ReadMe which is then formatted with gulp tasks.
