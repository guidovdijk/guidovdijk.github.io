                The Haarlem Festival was a second year school project where we
                promoted the city of Haarlem as an equal counter-part to
                Amsterdam with the use of a festival. The festival had 4
                different activities that needed to be promoted: The Cuisine,
                History, Dance and Jazz event. For these events you should also
                be able to pay a ticket. All the data for these events need to
                come from a CMS, which also needed to be designed and created.
                My part in this project was designing the CMS, Homepage, and the
                reusable components throughout the design (E.g., footer,
                navigation) and for the development I set up the project files,
                like Gulp and Webpack, created the base .SCSS files and created
                the CMS and payment system.

              <p className="text-body">
                The dashboard (just like the website itself) is made with PHP in
                combination with the MVC-pattern and the SCSS is written with
                BEM notations. Components that can be re-used are created in the
                components folder.
